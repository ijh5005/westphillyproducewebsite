          The Association, through its activities concerning issues of business, transportation, and social issues, affects the citizens of the greater West Philadelphia area daily. The economic success of an area is tied to its quality of life and for this reason the West Philadelphia Market Street Improvement Association places priorities in issues such as education, community, relations, medical facilities, and leisure activities. The effects of the association’s activities to improve the area’s quality of life will be numerous. One such example is the Association’s promotion and support of the community events in the city. The Association plans to host a West Market Street Run and Walk. The plan is to showcase Philadelphia and its partner, Millbourne with a Market Street Run/ Walk event. The starting line will begin at the Millbourne side of 63rd Street with the finish line at 15th and Market at City Hall. This event can be achieved with the help of all partners on the West Market Street corridor and partner’s down the Market Street corridor.
